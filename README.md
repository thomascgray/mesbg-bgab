# The MESBG Brother's Gray Army Builder

#### _An army list builder for the Middle Earth Strategy Battle Game_

# **VERY WIP, check back soon!**

## Features (eventually):

### **Browser based, modern interface, mobile friendly**

- Designed from the ground up to work on a variety of computer screen sizes.
- Edit, save, and display army lists from your phone, easy access for when you're in person.
- Don't need to install any software or run any programs or anything like that.
- I don't want (or care about, to be honest) your data, so no Google Analytics or tracking anywhere.

### **Save rosters to your computer browser's local storage (with an option to export to file)**

- Don't need to worry about exporting army lists or keeping track of the physical files.
- Can still export them if you want to move the army list to another computer, or for your own personal backup.

### **A focus on clean output of the army lists**

- Basically, Battlescribe's outputs make me feel like I'm losing my mind - it's a non-insignificant reason for me building this tool.
- Outputs to a variety of different formats, with several toggles and options for how much you want included in the final output. By default, it's pretty minimal.

### **Supports Tabletop Simulator from the get go**

- Auto calculates which distinct models you're going to need for your army, and builds a BBCode'ified output for each of those models that you can then easily copy and paste onto your TTS army.
- I personally play exclusively on TTS, so I have a vested interest in this not being shit.
