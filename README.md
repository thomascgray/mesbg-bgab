## The MESBG Brother's Gray Army Builder

### _An army list builder for the Middle Earth Strategy Battle Game_

# **VERY WIP, check back soon!**

## Features (eventually):

### **Browser based, modern interface, mobile friendly**

- Designed from the ground up to work on a variety of computer screen sizes.
- Edit and display army lists from your phone, easy access for when you're in person.
- Don't need to install any software or run any programs or anything like that.
- I don't want (or care about, to be honest) your data, so no Google Analytics on the page.

### **Save rosters to your computer browser's local storage (with an option to export to file)**

- Don't need to worry about exporting army lists or keeping track of the physical files.
- Can still export them if you want to move the army list to another computer, or for your own personal backup.

### **A focus on clean output of the army lists**

- Basically, Battlescribe's outputs make me feel like I'm losing my mind - they're a non-insignificant reason for me building this tool.
- Outputs to a variety of different formats, with several toggles and options for how much you want included in the final output. By default, it's pretty minimal.

### **Supports Tabletop Simulator from the get go**

- Auto calculates which distinct models you're going to need for your army, and builds a BBCode'ified output for each of those models, that you can then easily copy and paste onto your TTS army.
- I personally play exclusively on TTS, so I have a vested interest in this being as convinient as possible.

**TODO**

- models need some kind of "effective model count" cus some things can be purchased as they count as 2 models

  - e.g dwarf vault warden teams

- supporting things with multiple profiles for 1 choice e.g the 2 elves together

  - `ElladanAndElrohir`
  - now check with the dwarfs with different profiles

- upgrading units based on them being inside a specific hero's warband

  - durin
    that elf man

- upgrading units allowing changes to any of the stats of a unit

- units allowing new HEROES to join the army (balin the dwarf) at new heroic tiers

  - battlescribe doesnt support this

- support buying increases in a heros might, will, and fate for different point costs

  - started the data for this

- i THINK mumakil can just be a hero and the warband is any units taht can ride on it, etc.

- wargear needs a separate "summary name", as it can be useful to have 1 name in the listing, and 1 in the summary

  - e.g swaps, the listing needs to say "X (replaces Y)" but the summary should probably just say "X"

- things to put in data for easy access with TTS
  - spells
  - special rules

**Things I Know Are Missing (For Now!):**

- siege engines
